Hello there!

I am Daegoon Lee, a Program Evaluation Analyst at Employment Security Department of Washington State. I was born and grew up in South Korean until my mid-20's and moved to the United States for pursuing graduate study in 2010. Since then, I have lived in Knoxville, Tennessee, where I did my master's degree, Pullman, Washington, for my Doctoral degree, and Olympia, Washington.
